6.What is image Processing?
Image processing is a method to perform some important operations on an image. In order to get an enhanced high quality image or to extract the most useful information from that.
It is a one type of signal processing
In this processing input is an image and output may be image or charateristics/features associated with that image.

7.What is opencv?
"OpenCv is a open source library which is widely used for computer vision pupose".
It helps us to develop a system which can process image and real-time video using computer vision.
OpenCv focused on image processing,real-time video capturing to detect faces and objects.

8.History of OpenCv?
opencv was invented by intel in 1999 by Gary Bradsky.
The first release was in the year 2000.
opencv stands for open source computer vision library.
This library is based on optimized c/c++ and it supports java and python along with c++ through interface.

9.How image input works in computer?
"Converts the image into an array of pixel values where the dimension of array depends on the resolution of the image".
